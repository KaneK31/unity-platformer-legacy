# Unity Platformer (Recovered Source)

This is the decompiled source code from a Unity 2D platformer I originally developed. The project files were lost, but the code was recovered using [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpyEx) from the compiled game binary.

## 🎮 Features

- 2D movement, player and enemy AI
- Checkpoints and level transitions
- Shooting mechanics and item collection
- Enemy types: stationary, patrolling, and shooting
- Boss logic and health handling

## 📁 Recovered Components

Some of the core scripts:
- `PlayerMovement.cs`
- `GameManager.cs`
- `EnemyMovement.cs`, `EnemyShooting.cs`
- `AudioManager.cs`
- `Checkpoint.cs`, `LevelComplete.cs`
- `BossCs.cs`, `BossHp.cs`

## ⚠ Note

This is **not the original Unity project**, just the decompiled C# code. Some parts may be stripped or lack comments.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Unity (original game engine)
- dnSpyEx (for recovery)

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

I’m including this as part of my personal portfolio to showcase work I created before I had proper version control in place.
